# Chess-Engine
A bot capable of playing 3-check-chess, using the XBoard interface. Can perform all the classic chess moves like castling, promoting, en-passant.
Done by a team of 4 students. We used the Negamax algorithm, with Alpha-Beta pruning optimisation and Transposition tables to find the next optimal
move. The program can reach a depth of 6-7, but we consider improving it in the future.

To run our bot, simply run the command 'xboard -fcp "make run" -debug'.
